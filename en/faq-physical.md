# Mechanics

- Is it allowed to use different tires than those coming with the car?

  Yes, but only the tires from the list below. If you want to use
  something else, ask us at [Slack][slack] and we may extend the list.
  All teams should have a chance to use the same tires so we will
  allow only tires easily available to everybody.

  Currently allowed tires are:

  - [GRP Tyres T03 REVO](https://www.grpgandini.it/tyres/1-8-gt/t03-revo.html)
    All compounds (XB1 to XM7), all rim styles/colors are allowed.

  - [GRP Tyres T04 SLICK](https://www.grpgandini.it/tyres/1-8-gt/t04-slick.html)
    All compounds (XB1 to XM8), all rim styles/colors are allowed.

  - [Dynamite SpeedTreads Watch Dog (DYN8276)](https://nitrohobbies.com/dyn8276-2/)

  - [AKA 1:8 Buggy Tires](https://www.raceaka.com/18-Buggy-Tires_c_7.html)
    All Sub-Categories, all compounds, all inserts, all rims (types and colors).

  - [Contact RC tyres](https://www.racing-cars.com/wheels-tyres/on-road-tyres/brand-brand=contact-rc/)
    *Sh-types, all rims (types and colors)



- Is there an upper weight limit in the "restricted class"?

  No.

- Are we allowed to add extra (otherwise non-functional) weights (e.g.
  a small steel plate) to improve the traction of the car?

  The only non-functional weight allowed is to equally balance the car
  wheels. This weight must be statically mounted on the car.

- Are we allowed to change the transmission gear ratio of our cars?

  No.
  F1/10 competition is designed as a "Battle of the algorithms". From
  the very beginning, the emphasis was placed on lowering the effect
  of slight differences between the actual platforms (the teams might
  have different sensors, slightly different chassis models, etc.)
  so that the software is the true decisive component.
  Before, we have decided to loosen this slightly with allowing
  to change the tires, as the Traxxas stock tires are really not suitable
  for the competition surface. But beyond this, we would like the teams
  to focus on the software.

# Sensors

- Are any of the following vehicle-mounted cameras permitted in the
  "restricted class"?
  - [Intel Realsense L515](https://www.intelrealsense.com/lidar-camera-l515/): no
  - [Intel Realsense T265](https://www.intelrealsense.com/tracking-camera-t265/): no
  - [Intel Realsense D455](https://www.intelrealsense.com/depth-camera-d455/): yes
  - [Stereolabs ZED 2i](https://www.stereolabs.com/zed-2i/): yes


# Rules

- How will you signal the start of a race?

  For time trials you can start as soon as you are ready. Time
  measurement will start once you cross the starting line.

  For head to head, the stewards will yell "ready-set-go".
